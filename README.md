Day 1: July 1 2021
~ Setting up Express:
	- running express
	- install chalk
	- install debug
	- install morgan
	- use built in package path
	- serving index.html
	
	[Concepts so far]
	- what express should get at '/' using .get
	- what response should appear using .send (simple text for now)
	- have server listen on port using .listen
	- middleware (.use with morgan)
	- serving static files

NOTE: run server.js => node server.js
